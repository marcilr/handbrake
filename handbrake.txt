HandBrake is a general-purpose, open-source, cross-platform, multithreaded video transcoder
software application.[4]  HandBrake was originally developed by Eric "titer" Petit in 2003 as a
general-purpose video transcoder to make ripping a film from a DVD to a data storage device
easier.  Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions and become widely popular amongst
film enthusiasts.[5]

HandBrake makes use of many LGPL libraries from the Linux platform.[6]

HandBrake is a multi-threaded DVD to MPEG-4 ripper and converter.  It can encode directly from DVDs
(even encrypted ones) or from VIDEO_TS folders.  AC3, LPCM, and MPEG audio tracks are supported.
The output can be contained in MP4, AVI, or OGM files, and the output audio is encoded in either
AAC, MP3, or Vorbis.  Other features include support for 2-pass encoding, encoding of two audio
tracks, a bitrate calculator, and deinterlacing, cropping, and scaling of the original picture.

=============================
Today I learned that rather than combining the vobs, stored under say WEDDING_CRASHERS/VIDEO_TS/*,
into one vob using, using ~/bin/vob-combine script, it is better to just point handbrake to 
the VIDEO_TS/ directory itself.  Handbrake does a better job of eliminating the initial menu when 
it points to VIDEO_TS/ directory rather than single vob.

This needs to go into the transcoding document.

=============================
Whilst winter mountain biking with Jason Guild, Sunday January 13, 2013 around Campbell 
Airstrip we discussed transcoding DVDs.  I mentioned I had recently used makemkv to easily,
i.e. on-click, create *.mkv files from DVDs.  He asked if I had even used handbrake for
transcoding DVDs.  Advised that I had not in quite some time.

Seemed a good time to check it out again.  Find no handbrake in the debian distro though.
Need to determine use of handbrake on debian squeeze.

The current release, from download page, is version 0.9.8
