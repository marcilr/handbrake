http://handbrake.fr is a nice high level tool with a lot of useful presets for
mp4 for iPod, PS3, ... with both GUI and CLI interfaces for Linux, Windows and
Mac OS X.

It comes with its own dependencies as a single statically linked fat binary so
you have all the x264 / aac codecs included.

$ HandBrakeCLI -Z Universal -i myinputfile.mov -o myoutputfile.mp4

To list all the available presets:

$ HandBrakeCLI -z

Example
=======
HandBrakeCLI -Z Universal -i foo.mpeg -o foo.m4v


Remember that mp4 and m4v are the same format.
Apple's iTunes likes the m4v extension.
